# Net-Worm.Win32.Sasser

# Sasser is a computer worm that affects computers running vulnerable versions of the Microsoft operating systems Windows XP and Windows # 2000. Sasser spreads by exploiting the system through a vulnerable port. Thus it is particularly virulent in that it can spread without # user intervention, but it is also easily stopped by a properly configured firewall or by downloading system updates from Windows Update. # The specific hole Sasser exploits is documented by Microsoft in its MS04-011 bulletin, for which a patch had been released seventeen days # earlier.
